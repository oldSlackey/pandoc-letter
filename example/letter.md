I am applying for the role of OME Curator (reference: SLSC0423), which I saw advertised on the University vacancies website.  

My current role is Bioinformatician with Fios Genomics Ltd., a bioinformatics consultancy in Edinburgh, and my recent interests are in bioinformatics and computational biology, which I gained after completing my MSc in Bioinformatics, with Distinction, from University of Glasgow. My earlier research was in marine biology and ecology with my PhD completed in 2007. At Fios, I apply a broad range of statistical techniques to high-throughput sequencing, proteomics and array-based expression and methylation datasets to extract meaningful biological insights. My role at Fios also requires me to translate analytical needs into code, and contribute to the development of Fios' proprietary code base. The results of these analyses are presented to the clients as web reports, which I produce as part of the pipeline. My 18 months with Fios, and 13 months at my previous role with Glasgow Polyomics, have consolidated my R, Bash and Python programming knowledge along with version control (GitLab) and an introduction to web development using, for example, Markdown, SQL and JavaScript.  

In addition to my technical experience, the OME curator role appears to be an ideal match with my experience in working with collaborators and industrial clients. Although my current role at Fios requires confidentiality, my clients include large pharmaceutical and biosciences corporations, as well as academic partners. I have held research posts in academia, central government and industry, giving me a depth of experience in collaborative research, producing and analysing data, and translating industrial clients and non-technical colleagues needs into usable analyses. In the Scottish Government we were required to interpret research for policy and wider dissemination. I also helped to deliver short training courses in RNASeq whilst at Glasgow, and, in biology modules, as a demonstrator at Glasgow, Heriot-Watt and Edinburgh Napier. All of these experiences giving me an understanding of working with other scientists and non-technical stakeholders.  

The curator role interests me as I have worked with image analysis with the Marine Laboratory, when the types of open source platforms like OMERO and IDR were not available, and I am impressed with the depth of the tools available (I also have an interest in digital photography). The value of existing datasets is immense; access to high quality databases is almost a pre-requisite in modern biological research, and I have made some contributions to curating the Stemformatics data portal, and its equivalent at Glasgow Polyomics. I also believe high throughput image analysis is a relatively under-utilised tool in molecular biological research, and has enormous potential, but also significant challenges to becoming routine. I am confident my broad range of experience makes me a good match for this position.  

I would appreciate an opportunity to interview for the position to discuss the post in more detail.
